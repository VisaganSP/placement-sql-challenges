## üéì Placement Training SQL Problems

This set of SQL problems is designed for placement training, focusing on key concepts like:

- Ranking employees by salary within departments üè¢
- Identifying specific dates in sales data üìÖ
- Exploring various scenarios such as:
  - Finding employees without managers ü§î
  - Identifying employees with matching salaries across different departments üíº

These problems will help you practice writing complex SQL queries using concepts such as subqueries, window functions, and conditional filtering üõ†Ô∏è.
